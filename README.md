The Banks find it difficult to estimate Interest Rates they must charge for Customers based on the their Loans. An Interest Rate that is beneficial to the Bank and Satisfy the Customer is hard to find.

Here we tried to predict the class of Interest Rate Based on Loan Details from the Data Set. 

I used Random Forest Algorithm based on the features data, feature relationships and evaluation metrics. I also fine tuned them to provide better accuracy.
